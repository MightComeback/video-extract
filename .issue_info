TITLE:Tool: Fathom link → actionable bug report brief (CLI + copy/paste)
DESCRIPTION_START
## Outcome

Turn a Fathom recording/link into an *engineering-actionable* brief so you don’t watch the whole video.

## Inputs (MVP)

* A Fathom share link (or transcript/notes pasted if link is not fetchable).

## Output format (MVP)

* 1-sentence summary of the bug
* Repro steps (numbered)
* Expected vs actual
* Environment/context (who/where/when)
* Exact timestamp(s) from the call (if available)
* “Next actions” checklist
* Optional: suggested Linear/GitHub issue title

## Acceptance Criteria

* CLI command: `fathom2action <url>` OR `fathom2action --stdin`
* Produces deterministic markdown output (ready to paste into Linear/GitHub)
* Handles “cannot fetch link” gracefully (asks for transcript paste)

## Definition of Done

* Repo exists on [github.com/MightComeback](<http://github.com/MightComeback>) with README + examples
* First release tagged v0.1
* You use it on 3 real Fathom links and it saves you time
